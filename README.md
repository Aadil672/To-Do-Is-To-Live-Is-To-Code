# YK's Solution to Brainstation Code Challenge

Hello Brainstation! Here is my solution to the to-do app coding challenge.

## What it does and what you can do with it
- Add a Todo item
- List Todo items
- Toggle Todo items as complete using a checkbox
- Completed Todo items are greyed out with a strikethrough line through them
- A "Clear Complete" button removes all Todos that are marked as completed (this button is disabled if no Todos are done)
